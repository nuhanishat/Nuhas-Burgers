# Nuhas-Burgers
This is a simple web-based burger making game 🍔 called Nuha's Burgers. You pick ingredients 🥬 🧀 from a list of what's available and assemble your burger. It gives you a total price 💰 of the burger based on what ingredients you picked when you complete your order . Still a work in progress 👩🏾‍💻 I am working on making it responsive, currently it is not....

I also designed and created all the assets in the game myself.

Here's a preview of what it looks like:
